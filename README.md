# Pothole Patrol

Pothole Patrol is a comprehensive pothole management system for Chicago, built using real data from 30,000 pothole service requests submitted this year. With it, residents can report potholes, Chicago administrators can oversee pothole repair, and city crew members can access their daily repair assignments and update admins on their progress.

## Why

Pothole Patrol was created by four city of Chicago residents as their capstone project at FullStack Academy. As city residents, they were all too familiar with the condition of Chicago's asphalt-patchworked streets and were excited to develop a tool that could be used to address the issue.
